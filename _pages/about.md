A seasoned Technical Project Manager with a proven track record of delivering complex software and AI initiatives on time and under budget, I blend deep technical expertise with strategic vision to drive product, program, and organizational success. Holding a PMP certification and with five years of experience in healthcare IT, Web3, and AI product development, I’ve led globally distributed teams of up to 12 engineers, designers, and stakeholders—boosting velocity by as much as 30% through agile workflows, clear documentation, and continuous feedback loops.

As a strategic leader, I partner closely with C-suite stakeholders to translate high-level business goals into actionable roadmaps. At MerkleRoot, I spearheaded the development of an AI-powered food-service assistant that doubled daily user engagement while slashing operating costs by 90%. I’ve identified market-gap opportunities in decentralized finance, collaborated with design and engineering to prototype winning solutions, and guided cross-functional teams through every phase of the product lifecycle.

Equally comfortable in the trenches or the boardroom, my operational leadership spans process optimization, resource planning, and risk mitigation—ensuring smooth program execution and scalable operations. I leverage tools like Jira, Confluence, Figma, and GitHub Projects to keep teams aligned, communicate transparently, and adapt quickly to changing requirements.
